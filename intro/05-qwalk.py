# # Trial wave functions and QMC job management.
# This notebook walks through the process of building a QWalk job. 
# A few notes:
# * A QWalk writer, reader, and runner will work exactly the same as corresponding PySCF objects.
# * A QWalk manager will handle waiting for other runs to finish, and converting the files into a trial wave function.

# ### Setting up the trial wave function calculation.
# For the hydrogen run, let's optimize a Slater-Jastrow wave function with QWalk variance optimization.
# First step is setting up the mean field calculation.

    runner=PySCFRunnerLocal()
)


# The PySCF calculation is defined, but so far no calculations have been started.
# 
# QWalk writers can take explicit trial wave function input (as a string), but autogen can also handle it for you.
# Make a `TrialFunc` object with the manager you want to generate the trial wave function.

# ### Setting up the QWalk run.
# Now we can set up the corresponding objects for QWalk.

# So what just happened here? 
# After setting up the calculation, we called `nextstep` repeatedly and the QWalk manager:
# * Noticed the PySCF run was not complete, and ran the PySCF run.
# * The PySCF run exported the qwalk files needed by QWalk.
# * The `QWalkManager` generated its imput files using the files from PySCF.
# * `QWalkManager` ran QWalk and collected the QWalk results.
# 
# The TrialFunc objects are meant to be modular and flexible. 
# You can build TrialFunc objects in a variety of ways, which the next notebook will demonstrate.

# # Next: building different trial functions (06-trialfunctions.ipynb).
