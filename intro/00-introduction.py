# # Introduction to autogen.
# This notebook is meant to give an idea for what autogen is for, and why it might be useful to you.
# 
# The purpose of autogen is to automate some of the mundane workflow tasks associated with running QMC.
# * Writing input files, keeping track of input parameters.
# * Reading and checking results are not completely unreasonable.
# * Running jobs in batch, waiting for them to finish.
# * Restarting jobs that need more time to finish.
# * Keeping track of data and where it comes from.

# ### Hydrogen example
# To illustrate how autogen is supposed to work, here's a simple example of an hydrogen molecule VMC run. 
# 
# To learn how to set up a run like this, you should check out the other notebooks, which walk step-by-step through how this works.
# For now, just glance over this code and check out the results.
